ttdl (4.17.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New option `--update-threshold` for the command `postpone`. By default
     task's threshold date does not change when you postpone the task. This
     option enables updating the threshold date when a task is postponed.

ttdl (4.16.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  Improve filtering by custom tags: now you can combine filters by OR. E.g,
     "due=..yesterday|due=today;d_time=..1200" filters tasks that have either
    due date before today or ones that have due date today and d_time<=12:00

ttdl (4.15.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  Fix new tag filtering: now ranges with `none` at any end include tasks
     that have the tag missing
  *  Fix `--set-rec` when a new type of recurrence(weekdays) is used

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:59:55 -0800

ttdl (4.15.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New command-line option `-H` or `--no-headers` to suppress printing the
     task list header and footer
  *  New recurrence type: every week on one or more weekdays. Example:
     `rec:tue,fri due:2025-11-05` makes a task that is due every week on
     Tuesdays and Fridays starting from `2025-11-05`. Note that the first due
     date is not required to be Tuesday or Friday. This kind of tasks are
     always treated as a strict one when postponing.
  *  Added custom filter by any tag or set of tags. A new option
     `--filter-tag` is added for this. Use list of values or ranges to filter
     the task list. Note that it cannot filter by entities that are not tags.
     In other words, you can filter by `due` date but you cannot filter by
     project or context. Example:
     `--filter-tag="due=..2025-11-10;type:car,house`
     It shows only tasks that have due defined and the due date is before or
     on `2025-11-10`, also the task must have the tag `type` with a value
     `car` or `house`.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:44:36 -0800

ttdl (4.13.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New feature for recurrent tasks: add support for tag `until`. When the
     current task is done, a new task is created automatically only if the new
     due date does not exceed the value of `until`
  *  When creating a task with `until` tag, relative values are supported.
     E.g, `due:2025-10-20 rec:1w until:2m text` creates a task that repeats
     every week while new due date is less than or equal to `2025-12-20`.
  *  option `--fields` supports `until` to show it in a separate column
  *  Fix displaying the subject column when it is longer than the terminal
     window and the mode is `compact`
  *  The field `subject` in the output can be reordered. But when a subject is
     passed in the option `--fields` the output always uses compact mode. I.e,
     it always trims the subject to the width of the output, no word-wraps
  * Improved `postpone` command for strictly recurrent tasks: if a task is
    postponed for the time different from the tasks recurrence interval, TTDL
    creates a new task without recurrence with a due date equals the postponed
    date, and the original task's due is moved to the next due date
  * New command-line option `--group` available for the `list` command. After
    the option you can define a field by which the task will be grouped.
    Nested grouping is not supported. As well as grouping by some fields:
    creation, finish dates and priority.

ttdl (4.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New command "listhashtags" (with shortcuts "listhash" and "lh"). The
     command prints out all hashtags used in tasks. It is similar to
     existing "lp" and "lc" which list projects and contexts respectively.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 12 Feb 2025 18:42:32 -0800

ttdl (4.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New special dates are available when setting due and other dates. The new
     special dates are names of months. You can use short (3 first letters) or
     full month names. After substitution a month name is replaced with the
     first day of the month. Note that the date is always in the future. In
     other words, if you set 'due:dec' on the December 1st, the due date will
     be December 1st of the next year

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Fri, 17 Jan 2025 19:01:10 -0800

ttdl (4.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New command-line options `--init` and `--init-local` to create a default
     configuration file in the user's configuration or the current working

ttdl (4.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  New command-line option `--interactive`/`-i` for command `edit`. When it
     is set, and editor is defined, all options that modifies tasks are
     ignored and TTDL opens an editor with tasks that were filtered by the
     command line options. After closing the editor, if the tasks are changed
     and the text is not empty, TTDL updated the selected tasks. Example:
     - `ttdl edit -i` - open all tasks to edit in an external editor
     - `ttdl edit +proj -i` - open all tasks related to the project `proj` in
        an external editor.

ttdl (4.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  *  When editing a task or adding a new one, you can use simple expressions
     for date-like tags `due` and `t`:
        - `ttdl add "water plants t:2024-11-10 dur:t+5d`
        - `ttdl edit 1 --set-due=due+5d

ttdl (4.4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * On completing a recurrent task, the tags `tmr` and `spent` are removed
    from the newly created task.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 24 Aug 2024 20:23:11 -0700

ttdl (4.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Allow setting task completion date even if creation date is undefined. By
    default, TTDL works in the same way. You can enable setting completion
    date always by either modifying the configuration file (set option
    `global.add_completion_date_always` to `true`) or by passing a
    command-line option `--add-completion-date-always`

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 17 Jul 2024 21:22:22 -0700

ttdl (4.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New option `--keep-tags` or `-k` for edit mode. If the option is set, the
    command must contain a new subject text. A modified todo keeps all
    properties (project, context, tags, hashtags), but the regular text is
    replaced with the new subject
  * Update packages and fix clippy warnings

ttdl (4.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Forbid executing some operations if no filter is specified in command
    line. When running without specifying what tasks to process, the commands
    rm, edit, postpone, done, undone interrupt the application with an error

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:23:11 -0800

ttdl (4.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New recurrence interval: business days.
    It works as the day interval but all Sundays and Saturdays are skipped.
  * Now the character `~` can be used in configuration file to set todo and
    done files. `~` is a shortcut for user's home directory.
    Thanks to Enno Zickler(@ezickler) for contribution.
  * Updated docs:
    - Added description of strict and non-strict recurrences
    - Added ArchLinux installation intstructions. Thanks to Justin (@just1602)

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 14 Feb 2024 22:06:02 -0800

ttdl (4.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New command-line and configuraton option `priority-on-done`. The option
    defines what to do with task priority when the task is completed:
    keep: default mode - do nothing with priority
    move: place the priority after completion date
    erase: remove the priority
    tag: remove the priority and add a tag 'pri:' with the priority value
    Note that all modes, except 'erase' are reversible and properly restore
    task priority when the task is uncompleted

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 27 Jul 2023 19:40:31 -0700

ttdl (4.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New incompatible output format:
    - column width is not constant, its width fits the longest column value
    - columns are shown in the same order as they mentioned in the settings
  * Fixed incorrect syntax highlighting: project and tag colors were exchanged
  * Fixed removing threshold from subject when it is shown in a column
  * New command-line option `auto-hide-cols`: automatically hide columns which
    have no values
  * New command-line option `auto-show-cols`: automatically show tags,
    context, and project in separate columns
  * New command-line option `always-hide-cols`: never show the mentioned tags
    in separate columns. The option is good when used together with the option
    `auto-show-cols`

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 27 Jul 2023 19:40:31 -0700

ttdl (3.10.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed broken custom formatting: when a plugin changed any tag value, the
    tag was duplicated in the subject
  * Custom formatting behavior change: if a user wants to remove a tag from
    the subject, a plugin must set the empty value for the tag. Removing tag
    from the hashmap does not remove the tag from the subject any longer
  * Few small fixes in the example configuration ttdl.toml: corrected
    powershell command-line options and fields example section

ttdl (3.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Flag `--calendar` supports years (in a range -2..2). Now you can print the
    current year with `ttdl --calendar=1y`
  * Flag `--calendar` accept ranges: `ttdl --calendar=-2m..2m`
  * Added missing color reset when printing calendar: sometimes today's
    background was applied to an empty line after the month and sometimes
    month names were printed with week number color
  * New available columns `Project` and `Context`. They display task's
    projects and contexts respectively. Both are hidden by default.
    They can be shown by changing config or passing in command-line:
    `ttdl --fields=prj,ctx`
  * Tags, projects, and contexts can be hidden if they are already printed in
    their own columns. By default, the feature is off. To enable hiding,
    either pass command-line option `--clean-subject` or modify the
    configuration variable `global.clean_subject`

ttdl (3.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added command-line options to modify arbitrary tags: `--set-tag` and
    `--del-tag`
  * Added command-line options to manage hashtags: `--set-hashtag`,
    `--del-hashtag`, and `--repl-hashtags`
  * Added command-line option to filter by hashtags: `--hashtag`. Meta values
    like `any` and `none` are supported as it is done for tags.
  * Allow command `stats` to be used for `done.txt`. Now two commands works
    with `done.txt`: list and stats
  * Fixed incorrect calculation of overdue tasks: they were calculated only
    for active todos, so completed and overdue todos were counted as
    non-overdue ones
  * Removed `missing threshold` from `stats`. It was a misleading value
    because it was impossible to miss any threshold. Threshold is a date until
    which the todo is omitted from the default `list` output
  * Fixed incorrect detection of the number of overdue todos. The old
    algorithm compared due date and today's date always. But for completed
    todos it results in false positives. New detection algorithm for overdue:
    - a todo is active and its due date is earlier than today's date
    - a todo is done and it has finish date set, and the finish date goes
      after todo's due date
    In all other cases a todo is not considered an overdue one.
  * Add syntax highlighting for subject. The feature is disabled by default.
    When enabled, the default colors for:
    - tags = Cyan
    - hashtags = Bright Cyan
    - projects = Bright Green
    - contexts = Green
  * New command-line options `syntax` to enable syntax highlighting, and
    `no-syntax` to disable it
  * Updated example `ttdl.toml`: introduced a section `[syntax]` to tune up
    subject syntax highlighting

  * Support tag `h` to hide any todo from the output. If value of the tag is
    not `0`, the todo is excluded from all operations (except auto-compelete

ttdl (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `none` as a valid value for a range end. Using `none` in a range makes
    the range an open one. The result is the combination of two lists: an open
    one with real date, and all todos that have the date undefined.
    Example: `list --due=none..tomorrow` shows all todos that are overdue, due
    today or tomorrow, and that do not have a due date

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 08 Aug 2020 19:39:38 -0700

ttdl (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `soon` as a valid value for a range end. `-soon` works as well.
    The value of `soon` depends on the configuration value `ranges.soon`.
    If the value of config is zero, the value defaults to 7.

  * Add `overdue` as a valid value for a range end for consistency. Any
    range with a due is the same as an open range without 'overdue' part.
