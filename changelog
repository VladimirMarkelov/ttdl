ttdl (4.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New incompatible output format:
    - column width is not constant, its width fits the longest column value
    - columns are shown in the same order as they mentioned in the settings
  * Fixed incorrect syntax highlighting: project and tag colors were exchanged
  * Fixed removing threshold from subject when it is shown in a column
  * New command-line option `auto-hide-cols`: automatically hide columns which
    have no values
  * New command-line option `auto-show-cols`: automatically show tags,
    context, and project in separate columns
  * New command-line option `always-hide-cols`: never show the mentioned tags
    in separate columns. The option is good when used together with the option
    `auto-show-cols`

ttdl (3.10.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed broken custom formatting: when a plugin changed any tag value, the
    tag was duplicated in the subject
  * Custom formatting behavior change: if a user wants to remove a tag from
    the subject, a plugin must set the empty value for the tag. Removing tag
    from the hashmap does not remove the tag from the subject any longer
  * Few small fixes in the example configuration ttdl.toml: corrected
    powershell command-line options and fields example section

ttdl (3.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Flag `--calendar` supports years (in a range -2..2). Now you can print the
    current year with `ttdl --calendar=1y`
  * Flag `--calendar` accept ranges: `ttdl --calendar=-2m..2m`
  * Added missing color reset when printing calendar: sometimes today's
    background was applied to an empty line after the month and sometimes
    month names were printed with week number color
  * New available columns `Project` and `Context`. They display task's
    projects and contexts respectively. Both are hidden by default.
    They can be shown by changing config or passing in command-line:
    `ttdl --fields=prj,ctx`
  * Tags, projects, and contexts can be hidden if they are already printed in
    their own columns. By default, the feature is off. To enable hiding,
    either pass command-line option `--clean-subject` or modify the
    configuration variable `global.clean_subject`

ttdl (3.6.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix crashing `add` command when command-line option `--dry-run` is used

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 04 Mar 2023 11:12:21 -0800

ttdl (3.6.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve 32-bit compiler support

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2023 22:00:33 -0800

ttdl (3.6.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Empy todos are hidden by default. To show empty todos, use the
    command-line option `--all`
  * Command `clean`(`archive`) removes empty todos as well. To keep
    empty todos, pass the command-line option `--keep-empty`

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 29 Jan 2023 14:11:01 -0800

ttdl (3.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The command-line option `--syntax` did not work in `--compact` mode

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 28 Jan 2023 16:10:01 -0800

ttdl (3.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New feature: custom columns: define custom columns with highlight rules
    in `ttdl.toml` and display them with `--fields=field-name` option.
    Custom columns shows values of selected tags.
  * Switch to 2021 Rust edition

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 31 Dec 2022 12:08:30 -0800

ttdl (3.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added command-line options to modify arbitrary tags: `--set-tag` and
    `--del-tag`
  * Added command-line options to manage hashtags: `--set-hashtag`,
    `--del-hashtag`, and `--repl-hashtags`
  * Added command-line option to filter by hashtags: `--hashtag`. Meta values
    like `any` and `none` are supported as it is done for tags.
  * Allow command `stats` to be used for `done.txt`. Now two commands works
    with `done.txt`: list and stats
  * Fixed incorrect calculation of overdue tasks: they were calculated only
    for active todos, so completed and overdue todos were counted as
    non-overdue ones
  * Removed `missing threshold` from `stats`. It was a misleading value
    because it was impossible to miss any threshold. Threshold is a date until
    which the todo is omitted from the default `list` output
  * Fixed incorrect detection of the number of overdue todos. The old
    algorithm compared due date and today's date always. But for completed
    todos it results in false positives. New detection algorithm for overdue:
    - a todo is active and its due date is earlier than today's date
    - a todo is done and it has finish date set, and the finish date goes
      after todo's due date
    In all other cases a todo is not considered an overdue one.
  * Add syntax highlighting for subject. The feature is disabled by default.
    When enabled, the default colors for:
    - tags = Cyan
    - hashtags = Bright Cyan
    - projects = Bright Green
    - contexts = Green
  * New command-line options `syntax` to enable syntax highlighting, and
    `no-syntax` to disable it
  * Updated example `ttdl.toml`: introduced a section `[syntax]` to tune up
    subject syntax highlighting

    was marked as a done one

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 24 Jul 2022 11:13:25 -0700

ttdl (3.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New task view mode `--calendar=<range>` where `range` is a single value
    which denotes how long the calendar is. The value uses the same syntax as
    todo value `recurrent` with some extra contractions.

ttdl (3.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now threshold dates moves to the future like due dates when a todo is
    completed
  * On completion of a recurrent todo, its due and threshold dates are not
    modified. The todo is marked completed and a new todo is created with
    changed due and threshold dates.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 17 Oct 2021 11:53:01 -0700

ttdl (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed: ID '1' was always ignored when list of IDs was passed to TTDL
  * Fixed: generate list of unique IDs. Before '1,2,2' or '1,1-3' sent
    duplicated ID with number '2' to todo_lib.
  * New: list and ranges of IDs can be mixed
  * New: range of IDs now detect low and high ends automatically. Now
    `list 1-3` and `list 3-1` prints the same tasks in the same order.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:22:30 -0700

ttdl (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix regression: filter "due=none..4d" did not include tasks with empty due
    dates

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:38:51 -0700

ttdl (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * All ranges are now exclusive ones as the documentation states. Before the
    fix, ranges with `none` as one end were non-exclusive ones
  * Support tag `h` to hide any todo from the output. If value of the tag is
    not `0`, the todo is excluded from all operations (except auto-compelete
    functions)
  * Added a way to exclude todos what contains certain projects, contexts or
    tags from the list. Prepend `-` to a value to mark it as an exclusion.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 03 Oct 2021 11:10:19 -0700

ttdl (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 01 May 2021 17:50:19 -0700

ttdl (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Replace todotxt library with another one
  * Now project and context names are case-sensitive
  * All tags are preserved in a todo's subject (they were appended to the
    subject in the previous library)
  * Completing a todo with recurrence and threshodl do not chaneg theshold
  * Todo completion follows strict flag('+' character before a recurrence -
    e.g, "rec:+1m"): if strict flag is present, the next date is recurrence
    plus due date, otherwise recurrence plus the current date
  * A tag cannot have empty value. Setting empty value to a tag removes the
    tag from the subject completely
  * If a todo's text starts with two dates, and the todo is incomplete, only
    the first is parsed as creation date, and the rest goes to subject

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:40:34 -0800

ttdl (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

ttdl (0.10.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Enable range filter for threshold date
  * Fix conflict between two CLI options: there were `-A/--completed` and
    `--completed`. It resulted in the error `invalid date range` for any value
    after `--completed`. Now the former one is `-A/--only-completed`
  * Bump packages
  * Few clippy fixes

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Fri, 25 Dec 2020 17:20:17 -0800

ttdl (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `none` as a valid value for a range end. Using `none` in a range makes
    the range an open one. The result is the combination of two lists: an open
    one with real date, and all todos that have the date undefined.
    Example: `list --due=none..tomorrow` shows all todos that are overdue, due
    today or tomorrow, and that do not have a due date

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 08 Aug 2020 19:39:38 -0700

ttdl (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `soon` as a valid value for a range end. `-soon` works as well.
    The value of `soon` depends on the configuration value `ranges.soon`.
    If the value of config is zero, the value defaults to 7.

  * Add `overdue` as a valid value for a range end for consistency. Any
    range with a due is the same as an open range without 'overdue' part.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 30 Jul 2020 21:56:09 -0700

    filter by creation and finish dates

  * New command-line arguments for filtering: '--created' and '--finished'

ttdl (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New feature: allow using human-readable dates when setting due and
    threshold dates in todo's text and for --set-due/--set-threshold
    commands. Since this version it is possible to, e.g., write "due:1w"
    to set the due date in a week from the current date.

  * New commands 'listprojects' and 'listcontexts' to list all
    project/context tags. Supports the same filters as the "list" command.

  * Remove 'Threshold' and 'Spent' columns from default output.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 11 Jul 2020 12:43:11 -0700
