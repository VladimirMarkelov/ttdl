ttdl (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix `set-rec` command: it modified todo's recurrent date only if the todo
    was marked as a done one

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sun, 24 Jul 2022 11:13:25 -0700

ttdl (3.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New task view mode `--calendar=<range>` where `range` is a single value
    which denotes how long the calendar is. The value uses the same syntax as
    todo value `recurrent` with some extra contractions.

ttdl (3.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now threshold dates moves to the future like due dates when a todo is
    completed
  * On completion of a recurrent todo, its due and threshold dates are not
    modified. The todo is marked completed and a new todo is created with
    changed due and threshold dates.

ttdl (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed: ID '1' was always ignored when list of IDs was passed to TTDL
  * Fixed: generate list of unique IDs. Before '1,2,2' or '1,1-3' sent
    duplicated ID with number '2' to todo_lib.
  * New: list and ranges of IDs can be mixed
  * New: range of IDs now detect low and high ends automatically. Now
    `list 1-3` and `list 3-1` prints the same tasks in the same order.

ttdl (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix regression: filter "due=none..4d" did not include tasks with empty due
    dates

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:38:51 -0700

ttdl (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * All ranges are now exclusive ones as the documentation states. Before the
    fix, ranges with `none` as one end were non-exclusive ones
  * Support tag `h` to hide any todo from the output. If value of the tag is
    not `0`, the todo is excluded from all operations (except auto-compelete
    functions)
  * Added a way to exclude todos what contains certain projects, contexts or
    tags from the list. Prepend `-` to a value to mark it as an exclusion.

ttdl (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upgrade packages
  * Update README

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 01 May 2021 17:50:19 -0700

ttdl (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Replace todotxt library with another one
  * Now project and context names are case-sensitive
  * All tags are preserved in a todo's subject (they were appended to the
    subject in the previous library)
  * Completing a todo with recurrence and threshodl do not chaneg theshold
  * Todo completion follows strict flag('+' character before a recurrence -
    e.g, "rec:+1m"): if strict flag is present, the next date is recurrence
    plus due date, otherwise recurrence plus the current date
  * A tag cannot have empty value. Setting empty value to a tag removes the
    tag from the subject completely
  * If a todo's text starts with two dates, and the todo is incomplete, only
    the first is parsed as creation date, and the rest goes to subject

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:40:34 -0800

ttdl (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Todos can be filtered by tag names
  * New options to filter by projects(--project), contexts(--context), and
    tags(--tag) in addition to original filtering with `@` and `+`.
  * New strict mode(disabled by default, enabled via configuration file or
    command-line option)

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Tue, 29 Dec 2020 20:23:43 -0800

ttdl (0.10.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Enable range filter for threshold date
  * Fix conflict between two CLI options: there were `-A/--completed` and
    `--completed`. It resulted in the error `invalid date range` for any value
    after `--completed`. Now the former one is `-A/--only-completed`
  * Bump packages
  * Few clippy fixes

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Fri, 25 Dec 2020 17:20:17 -0800

ttdl (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `none` as a valid value for a range end. Using `none` in a range makes
    the range an open one. The result is the combination of two lists: an open
    one with real date, and all todos that have the date undefined.
    Example: `list --due=none..tomorrow` shows all todos that are overdue, due
    today or tomorrow, and that do not have a due date

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 08 Aug 2020 19:39:38 -0700

ttdl (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add `soon` as a valid value for a range end. `-soon` works as well.
    The value of `soon` depends on the configuration value `ranges.soon`.
    If the value of config is zero, the value defaults to 7.

  * Add `overdue` as a valid value for a range end for consistency. Any
    range with a due is the same as an open range without 'overdue' part.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Thu, 30 Jul 2020 21:56:09 -0700

ttdl (0.10.0) unstable; urgency=medium

    filter by creation and finish dates

  * New command-line arguments for filtering: '--created' and '--finished'

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 25 Jul 2020 20:43:17 -0700

ttdl (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New feature: allow using human-readable dates when setting due and
    threshold dates in todo's text and for --set-due/--set-threshold
    commands. Since this version it is possible to, e.g., write "due:1w"
    to set the due date in a week from the current date.

  * New commands 'listprojects' and 'listcontexts' to list all
    project/context tags. Supports the same filters as the "list" command.

  * Remove 'Threshold' and 'Spent' columns from default output.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Sat, 11 Jul 2020 12:43:11 -0700

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:17:23 -0700

    list. If the path is a directory, "todo.txt" is added automatically

    automatically. If the path contains only file name, it inherits directory
    from the path to todo list.

 -- Vladimir Markelov <vmatroskin@gmail.com>  Wed, 20 Feb 2019 22:32:54 -0800
