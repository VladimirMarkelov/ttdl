# The configuration file follows TOML format rules: https://toml.io/
# Note on file paths:
#   On Windows a file path usually includes backslashes. When TOML parses a string
#   enclosed into double quotes, it treats backslashes as escape characters. This
#   results in errors when loading a configuration file. To avoid this trouble, use
#   one of the following ways to put a file path to the configuration:
#   1. Use single quotes instead of double ones:
#     filename = 'c:\Users\user\todo.txt'
#   2. Duplicate backslashes:
#     filename = "c:\\Users\\user\\todo.txt"
#   3. Replace backslashes with slashes:
#     filename = "c:/Users/user/todo.txt"
#
# A TTDL config can be in the current working directory - to support
#   ttdl settings on per project basis. Global user config must be in:
# * Linux: ~/.config/ttdl/ttdl.toml
# * Windows: c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ttdl\ttdl.toml
# * MacOS: /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/ttdl/ttdl.toml
#
# All section must exists in the custom configuration file, but all options
#   inside every section are optional.
#
# available colors (names are case-insensitive):
#   black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
# every color may have up to 3 modifiers:
#   bold, underline, bright(or intense)
# the first two modifiers works only in ANSI-compatible terminal.
# To make them work on Windows, use ConEmu or Cmder instead
#   of standard cmd or PowerShell.
# For Cmder/ConEmu and Linux terminals indexed 256-color terminal and
#   RGB colors are supported as well. Format for indexed colors is the index
#   of the color(enclosed in double quotes):
#   overdue="140"
#   Format for RGB is enclosed in double quotes a comma separated list of 3
#   numbers (order of colors is R,G,B) :
#   overdue="220,0,0"
#   For both indexed and RGB colors the number can be either decimal between
#   0 and 255 or hexadecimal in range 0x0 - 0xFF. In latter case, it must start
#   with  "0x".
# If a color value cannot be parsed it defaults to 'white'
